# Webshop with php and mysql
This webshop was created as part of my studies. It is a simple webshop with a login system, a shopping cart and a checkout. The webshop is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database.

As an extra, a Linux server with Apache was also set up and made available online with the help of ngrok.io.

As seen on github.com no graphical tool was used.
The project was programmed with the code editor VSCode.
The fatal naming of the variables ... you can also see that little code is copy and paste.

The frameworks Bootstrap and w3 were used.

The design is mostly self-made, and the layout was optimized using css for a responsive design.
